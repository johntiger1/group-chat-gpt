### Installation

Install the dependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/SamX23/group-chat-app.git
$ pnpm i
$ pnpm start
```

### TODO (john)
- need to scrub the API key so that it reads it in from a secret location
- moreover, need to somehow separate the app so that it is a true server/clinet breakdown
- the app which gets shipped to consumers should not be pnpm ! 
- rather, we need to ship the app somewhere (host it) as well as expose a client too
- recall separating a client/server app !  

### Contribution

I will receive any PR (Pull Request) from anyone! Please read the CONTRIBUTING.md for more information.
